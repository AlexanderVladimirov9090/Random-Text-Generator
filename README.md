A program that takes in a text file and uses the words to randomly generate a new text.
This generator looks at sets of three consecutive words and remembers all the words
that follow the sets. Of all these follow-up words, one is chosen randomly
to form a new text. This technique is called the Markov chain.

### Contributing

This program is beginner-friendly and I would like to invite new programmers to start engaging in open source here.
Here's a list of what still needs to be added:
- A different implementation of the RandomTextGenerator class called the SpaceEfficientGenerator
which doesn't use as much space, but sacrifices processor power instead
- A file chooser in the main method where the user can open a .txt file to generate random text.
- A simple GUI with a text field to type in or copy in a big piece of text. 
- A 'generate' button to generate text somewhere in the GUI.

If you have ideas for a new feature, feel free to start an issue in the Issue Tracker and discuss the new feature with me.
Creativity is the key to innovation!
